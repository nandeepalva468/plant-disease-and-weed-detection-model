# About the Project
ðŸŒ¿ About This Project
Plant Disease and Weed Detection Model is a machine learning-based solution designed to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in identifying common plant diseases and weeds through image recognition. By leveraging computer vision and deep learning techniques, this project aims to enhance crop monitoring, reduce yield loss, and support sustainable farming practices.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
ðŸŒ± Plant Disease Detection: Accurately identifies various diseases affecting crops by analyzing leaf images.

ðŸŒ¾ Weed Detection: Differentiates between crops and unwanted weeds to aid in targeted weed management.

ðŸ¤– Deep Learning Model: Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for robust image classification.

ðŸ“· Image-Based Input: Accepts images taken from mobile phones or field cameras.

ðŸ’¡ User-Friendly Interface (optional â€“ if you have one): Simple interface for uploading images and viewing predictions.

ðŸ’» Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / PyTorch

OpenCV

NumPy & Pandas

Streamlit / Flask (if applicable)

Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation and training

ðŸš€ Use Cases
Early detection of plant diseases to minimize crop damage.

Precise weed management to reduce chemical usage.

Integration with drones or mobile apps for real-time field analysis.
